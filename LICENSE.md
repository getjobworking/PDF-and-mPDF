MIT + NoGov

<b>Introduction</b>: In the realm of open-source development, concerns have arisen regarding the responsible and equitable use of code shared by independent developers. This discussion centers on the need for ethical considerations and the establishment of license terms that reflect the values of individual developers, especially when it comes to government entities and officials.

<b>License Terms</b>: The license governing the use of open-source code plays a pivotal role in defining how the code can be utilized. In the spirit of transparency and fairness, developers are increasingly adopting the MIT License with an additional clause, hereinafter referred to as "NOGOV License." The NOGOV License expressly restricts the usage of the code by government officials and institutions, reserving the rights exclusively for non-governmental entities and individuals.

<b>NOGOV License Clause</b>: The NOGOV License is an extension of the MIT License that explicitly prohibits the use of the code by any government official, agency, or institution. It serves as a protective measure for developers who wish to ensure that their contributions are not leveraged by government entities without their explicit consent.

<b>Rationale Behind NOGOV License</b>: The inclusion of the NOGOV License clause stems from the desire of developers to maintain control over the distribution and application of their work. It is driven by a belief in individual autonomy and the right to dictate how one's creations are utilized, particularly in contexts where government involvement may raise ethical concerns or violate the developer's principles.

<b>Ethical Considerations</b>: The NOGOV License reflects ethical considerations related to the responsible use of open-source code. Developers assert their right to define the boundaries of permissible usage, emphasizing a commitment to ethical practices and ensuring that their work aligns with their values.

<b>Community Awareness and Support</b>: The adoption of the NOGOV License extends beyond an individual choice; it is a call for community awareness and support. By collectively recognizing and respecting these license terms, developers aim to foster an environment where the principles of ethical software usage are upheld, and the rights of individual creators are safeguarded.

<b>Conclusion</b>: The NOGOV License represents a proactive response to ethical concerns surrounding the use of open-source code by government entities. It provides developers with a mechanism to express their values and expectations regarding the application of their work, promoting a community-driven commitment to responsible and equitable software usage.
