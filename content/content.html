		<strong>Title: Open-Source Code Usage Restriction for Government
			Entities: License Terms</strong>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Introduction:</strong> In the realm of open-source
		development, concerns have arisen regarding the responsible and
		equitable use of code shared by independent developers. This
		discussion centers on the need for ethical considerations and the
		establishment of license terms that reflect the values of individual
		developers, especially when it comes to government entities and
		officials.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>License Terms:</strong> The license governing the use of
		open-source code plays a pivotal role in defining how the code can be
		utilized. In the spirit of transparency and fairness, developers are
		increasingly adopting the MIT License with an additional clause,
		hereinafter referred to as &quot;NOGOV License.&quot; The NOGOV
		License expressly restricts the usage of the code by government
		officials and institutions, reserving the rights exclusively for
		non-governmental entities and individuals.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>NOGOV License Clause:</strong> The NOGOV License is an
		extension of the MIT License that explicitly prohibits the use of the
		code by any government official, agency, or institution. It serves as
		a protective measure for developers who wish to ensure that their
		contributions are not leveraged by government entities without their
		explicit consent.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Rationale Behind NOGOV License:</strong> The inclusion of the
		NOGOV License clause stems from the desire of developers to maintain
		control over the distribution and application of their work. It is
		driven by a belief in individual autonomy and the right to dictate how
		one&#39;s creations are utilized, particularly in contexts where
		government involvement may raise ethical concerns or violate the
		developer&#39;s principles.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> The NOGOV License reflects
		ethical considerations related to the responsible use of open-source
		code. Developers assert their right to define the boundaries of
		permissible usage, emphasizing a commitment to ethical practices and
		ensuring that their work aligns with their values.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Community Awareness and Support:</strong> The adoption of the
		NOGOV License extends beyond an individual choice; it is a call for
		community awareness and support. By collectively recognizing and
		respecting these license terms, developers aim to foster an
		environment where the principles of ethical software usage are upheld,
		and the rights of individual creators are safeguarded.
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>Conclusion:</strong> The NOGOV License represents a proactive
		response to ethical concerns surrounding the use of open-source code
		by government entities. It provides developers with a mechanism to
		express their values and expectations regarding the application of
		their work, promoting a community-driven commitment to responsible and
		equitable software usage.

		<em><strong>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</strong></em> is a 1900
		children's novel written by author L. Frank Baum and illustrated by W.
		W. Denslow.<sup>[1]</sup> It is the first novel in the Oz series of
		books. A Kansas farm girl named Dorothy ends up in the magical Land of
		Oz after she and her pet dog Toto are swept away from their home by a
		cyclone.<sup>[2]</sup> Upon her arrival in the magical world of Oz,
		she learns she cannot return home until she has destroyed the Wicked
		Witch of the West.<sup>[3]</sup>
	</p>
	<p>
		The book was first published in the United States in May 1900 by the
		George M. Hill Company.<sup>[4]</sup> In January 1901, the publishing
		company completed printing the first edition, a total of 10,000
		copies, which quickly sold out.<sup>[4]</sup> It had sold three
		million copies by the time it entered the public domain in 1956. It
		was often reprinted under the title <em><strong>The Wizard of Oz</strong></em>,
		which is the title of the successful 1902 Broadway musical adaptation
		as well as the classic 1939 live-action film.<sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup>
	</p>
	<p>
		The ground-breaking success of both the original 1900 novel and the
		1902 musical prompted Baum to write thirteen additional Oz books which
		serve as official sequels to the first story. Over a century later,
		the book is one of the best-known stories in American literature, and
		the Library of Congress has declared the work to be "America's
		greatest and best-loved homegrown fairytale."<sup>[7]</sup>
	</p>
	<p>
		L. Frank Baum's story was published by George M. Hill Company.<sup>[4]</sup>
		The first edition had a printing of 10,000 copies and was sold in
		advance of the publication date of September 1, 1900.<sup>[4]</sup> On
		May 17, 1900, the first copy came off the press; Baum assembled it by
		hand and presented it to his sister, Mary Louise Baum Brewster. The
		public saw it for the first time at a book fair at the Palmer House in
		Chicago, July 5–20. Its copyright was registered on August 1; full
		distribution followed in September.<sup>[8]</sup> By October 1900, it
		had already sold out and the second edition of 15,000 copies was
		nearly depleted.<sup>[4]</sup>
	</p>
	<p>In a letter to his brother, Baum wrote that the book's publisher,
		George M. Hill, predicted a sale of about 250,000 copies. In spite of
		this favorable conjecture, Hill did not initially predict that the
		book would be phenomenally successful. He agreed to publish the book
		only when the manager of the Chicago Grand Opera House, Fred R.
		Hamlin, committed to making it into a musical stage play to publicize
		the novel.</p>
	<p>
		The play <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> debuted on June 16, 1902. It was
		revised to suit adult preferences and was crafted as a "musical
		extravaganza," with the costumes modeled after Denslow's drawings.
		When Hill's publishing company became bankrupt in 1901,<sup>[9]</sup>
		the Indianapolis-based Bobbs-Merrill Company resumed publishing the
		novel.<sup>[10]</sup><sup>[9]</sup> By 1938, more than one million
		copies of the book had been printed.<sup>[11]</sup> By 1956, sales had
		grown to three million copies.
